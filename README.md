# collinear

This repository is a project from Princeton's Algorithms class. The aim of the assignment is to prove that sorting points to compare them is much faster than comparin each point to each other. The Java class BruteCollinearPoints is the brute force method of finding line segments of at least four points by comparing each point to each other for every possible combination of points using four nested for loops. The FastCollinearPoints class takes a different approach in finding line segments where instead of doing n^4 comparisons to check by brute force, the slopes of each point are found so if two points have the same slope with respect to another point, they are all part of the same line segment. This search method significantly speeds up the program and demonstrates the effectiveness of comparables and sorting. The repository contains the code files in the src folder as well as files for testing the program actually works.
